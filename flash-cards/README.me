# Program Outline:

We have basically six steps:

1. Setup the cards data that we want to quiz ourselves with
2. Write code that reads the cards data and parses it into a python dictionary
3. Write code that iterates over the cards
4. Get the users's input for each question
5. Check the users input against the answer
6. Display "Correct!" or "Incorrect!"
