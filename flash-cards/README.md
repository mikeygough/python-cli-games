# Program Outline:

We have basically six steps:

1. Setup the cards data that we want to quiz ourselves with
2. Write code that reads the cards data and parses it into a python dictionary
3. Write code that iterates over the cards
4. Get the users's input for each question
5. Check the users input against the answer
6. Display "Correct!" or "Incorrect!"

Supports the following features:
[X] Ask them if they want to study again at the end.
[X] Randomize the order of questions.
[X] Keep playing until the player gets all the questions right at least once.
[X] Create various data files that are different sets of questions and let users pick which one they want to do. Users can select based on key instead of deck title.
[X] Let users enter their own cards and save those as libraries of questions and answers. -> in make_flashcards.py.
[X] Adding a title to a deck (more human readable form of the filename).

#### Write pseudo code that describes the flashcards game.
