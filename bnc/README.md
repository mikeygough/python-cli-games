# Program Outline:

We have basically four steps:

1. Command Line user input
2. The computer randomly picking a role
3. Checking the player's role and the computer's role
4. Displaying who won

Supports the following features:
[X] Ask them if they want to play again at the end.
[X] Randomize the order of questions.
[X] Keep playing until the player gets all the questions right at least once.
[X] Create various data files that are different sets of questions and let people pick which one they want to do.
[X] Let people enter their own cards and save those as libraries of questions and answers. -> in make_flashcards.py.
[X] Adding a title to a deck (more human readable form of the filename).
